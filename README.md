## Description
The purpose of this application is to enable independent web developers to generate basic logos for their projects and clients. With the use of inquirer, the user is prompted in the command line to specify the desired appearance of their logo, including the text to be displayed (up to three characters), the color of the text, the logo's shape (triangle, square, or circle), and the color of the shape. After the user completes all prompts, a logo is created using their selections in an SVG file.
